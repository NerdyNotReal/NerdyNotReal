# 👋 Hello, I’m NerdyNotReal  

Welcome to my GitHub. I build things, break them, and then act like it was all part of the plan.  

## 🚀 About Me  
- **Ongoing Quest:** Creating a **form builder**—because apparently, forms are the pinnacle of human-computer interaction.  
- **Philosophy:** The code compiles, therefore I am.  
- **Fun Fact:** I once tried to center a div and ended up questioning my entire existence.
- **Cats:** Big fan. They judge me, but I respect that.

## 🛠️ My Work  
### 🧩 [Form Builder](https://github.com/NerdyNotReal/FormBuilder) *(ongoing)*  
A drag-and-drop form builder designed to make creating forms easy—at least for others.  
- Built from scratch with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP** (because I like my challenges handcrafted).  
- Features **collaborative editing**, **custom components**, and **a growing to-do list I keep avoiding**.  

---

## 🌱 What I’m Learning  
- **Node.js**—so I can officially say I’ve moved on from PHP (no hard feelings).  
- **UI/UX Design**—trying to make things intuitive, despite my life being anything but.

## 🤝 Connect with Me  
- **GitHub:** [NerdyNotReal](https://github.com/NerdyNotReal)  
- **LinkedIn:** I’m working on a bio that doesn’t sound like a cover letter.
